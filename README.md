## Introducing the Geo Calculation Toolkit API

**Geo Calculation Toolkit** is a utility-focused API suite for working with geographic coordinates and shapes.

It offers practical functions such as calculating distances, lengths, and containment for points, lines, and areas ‚Äî useful in location-based logic, simple map processing, or spatial validations in backend services.
