![intersection-between-a-polyline-and-a-polygonal-area](./img/intersection-between-a-polyline-and-a-polygonal-area.png)

This image shows how the API determines whether a polyline intersects with a polygonal area.

- Line A represents a polyline composed of connected segments defined by consecutive geographic coordinates.
- Shape B represents a polygonal area formed by an ordered sequence of vertices.
- The zoomed-in view illustrates multiple intersection points where the path of Line A crosses the boundary of Polygon B.

The API returns a boolean value indicating whether the polyline and the polygon intersect.
